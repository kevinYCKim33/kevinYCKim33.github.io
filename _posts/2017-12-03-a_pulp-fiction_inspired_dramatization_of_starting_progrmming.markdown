Just saw that I am technically not done with my blog requirements, as this had been a filler text where I test out my blog errors.  Anyways, I will do a top five things I wish I knew before enrolling in Flatiron/things that I was glad I did during my stay in Flatiron.

1. <b>I wish I had learned some HTML/CSS prior </b>: Flatiron School teaches a lot,  and I am extremely grateful that I found a curriculum that matches my style of learning.  (Reading a lot!)  I wish though I had a few more HTML/CSS chops in me when it came time to attack these projects.  Though I learned a lot about MVC, database, etc, etc...I found myself stuck on questions like *why did this div break when I wrote this?* or *why is this column not resizing?*  It's like I knew I learned a lot, but I couldn't speak the right language to what seemed at first like a glorified version of PowerPoint presentation.  Do not underestimate these web designers!  

2.<b> I'm glad I learned at my own pace</b>: This was the biggest draw for me in choosing Flatiron's Online Program.  For some reason, the idea of spending 70 hours a week for 15 straight weeks didn't seem to add up.  Sure when I first quit my job, and I had this burst of energy like I can take on the world with a renewed sense of self and crank out those hours. But ask again come week 10.  I just wasn't sure how I'd feel mentally and physically.  It could've turned out well, but it seemed like some crazy science experiment that I didn't want to risk my future 20-year career on.  

3.<b>I'm glad I printed out every single README</b>: Yes this is true.  I am a reader,  and I like annotating on my notes.  Writing jeery remarks with my blue pen to have a conversation with the book.  It's something I was taught to do since sixth grade, to make my books unsellable because I was practicing *active reading*.  Coding seems a lot easier when you have arrows and circles drawn everywhere.  

4. <b>I'm glad I challenged myself with these projects</b>: There's a lot of doomsday talk with bootcamps floating around the Internet.  One of it was, to don't walk out of bootcamp with just a simple CRUD app.  So I made a Venmo clone and called it Vendough.  Trying to mimic Venmo's behavior really made me stretch my knowledge of Object Orientation as it veered away from the typical Post-Author-Tags-Comments model, and it really strenghtend my SQL queries (i.e. approved or unapproved transactions, transactions that logged in user has been involved in, transactions that the logged in user initiated,  listing transactions that are approved but not involving the user, etc. etc...these all sound very SQL'y)  The app also made me think about how to think like a hacker and how to prevent them.  What seemed like a slightly harder CRUD app turned into a very intellectually stimulating project.

5. <b>I wish I took advantage of the flexible schedule</b>:  For the first time in a long time, I was no longer constricted to some 9-6 schedule set up by The Man.  When I first started, I envisioned myself coding while riding an Amtrak ride from San Francisco to Seattle, sipping coffee, with farms stretching off for miles and miles, then pensively sighing and going back to coding out a beautiful Rails app like the modern day Henry David Thoreau that I am.  Suffice it to say, it did not exactly turn out like that.  I guess career changes are not as Instagram-friendly as I had thought.  

Hope you enjoyed this read. Add me on LinkedIn if you want.
