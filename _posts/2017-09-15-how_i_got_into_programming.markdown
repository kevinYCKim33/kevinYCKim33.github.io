## May, 2017
 
Stuck in a traffic jam on the way back from Napa Valley, after serving as a tour guide for my friends, I formed a roadmap of my life for the next nine months in my head that I found unnerving and exhilarating at the same time.

I will quit my job at the end of the month.

I am not quitting to switch companies. 

I am leaving the structural engineering industry for good.

I will self-study programming for two months, and then take the plunge into a coding bootcamp.

I will be a developer in 2018.  

I will have to move in with my mom in the meanwhile.  Every 27-year-old man's dream. * 

## August ~ December 2006
 
My first introduction to programming came sophomore year of high school when I took a course called *Computer Science* innocuously thinking that it's basically the same class from middle school where you get an A for pretending to learn how to type for the first time (while proceeding to play Flash games in between). A nice complement to getting an A for playing dodgeball and kickball right after lunch.  
 
The course started out slowly enough where we learned to double-click on the coffee cup icon and have it output "Hello World!" Eventually, the course got increasingly complex for my young high-school mind where we were executing for-loops and if statements and writing functions, and somehow, at the end of the course, we were making this very MS Paint looking interactive drawing where with each mouse click, the sun would slowly rise up from the lake and set under the mountains illuminating and dimming its surroundings in the meanwhile.   
 
I had registered in a learning curve I never asked for, and felt basically out of my element for the first 90% of the course.  It was so unlike the English/Math/Science/History class cycle that I was used to.  I do recall on the second to last week of the course,  I figured out a coding problem before anyone else could, and these kids sort of rolled their eyes like "oh of course, the Asian kid gets it." (I must mention I grew up in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado)  
 
I peaked at the right moment in the course, proceeded to ace the final, and promptly dropped the course for the spring semester, though feeling proud but never quite seeing the practicality of what I'd just learned--oblivious that the first iPhone would come out six months later (and will never stop coming out) and that I'll be living out in the Bay Area starting August of 2015. 
 
## January 2014 ~ June 2015

After getting my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at University of Colorado Boulder in December of 2013, I moved out to California ten days later to start my Master's program in Structural Engineering at University of California at Davis--basically doubling down on my personal essay I wrote as a 19-year-old kid which most likely was chock full of bold and cliché proclamations like: "I knew I was destined to be a structural engineer when my parents got me a box of Legos when I was four." 
 
Throughout the program, we were tasked to build several programs through MatLab such as where we would build a 3-D model where users would put in joint coordinates and the stiffness of the steel beam, and subject the model to external forces and moments then the program would output  the reaction/internal forces as well as the max deflection of the etc. etc. **the details of it aren't that important… what is important was that…**
 
I really enjoyed the process of programming this time around. It started with a professor drawing up a seemingly endless flowchart and we were tasked to figure out how to translate it into code.  I liked figuring out how to implement a part of the professor's pseudocode late at night, and couldn't wait to share (humblebrag) it with my study group the next day.  I liked pair-programming before I even knew what that meant.  I liked that rush of feeling I got when I walked away from a nasty bug and then figuring out how to debug it over a bike ride.  
 
I liked that feeling so much that I chose to do my Master's project to graduate from the program.
 
Virtually every day for eight weeks from April to June, I turned strangely nocturnal, and would enter the computer lab at 9pm with a can of Red Bull (no longer part of my diet) and built parts of the program with just my Structural Dynamics textbook, Stack Overflow, and YouTube, and quietly disappear out of the lab and into the daylight just as the 8am classes began. At the end of the project, what started as a blank file, was now accepting earthquake acceleration data (historic or hypothetical) and outputting a chimney model that would shake and sway to an earthquake data I had put in.    
 
## August 2015 ~ May 2017
 
I went through waves of interviews for a structural engineering position in the Bay Area after graduation, showing to my prospective employers my Master's project that I was quite proud of.  It was met with a lot of "oh that's cute" smile followed by a pivot question asking more about my background in steel/wood/concrete design courses.  I accepted an offer at a firm in San Francisco, and worked there for 1.5 years.  
 
It just didn't quite feel right to me. I just felt this weird dissonance of  designing and drawing up things for contractors to build, without ever having built any of these myself.  When things did get built in real-life, I felt proud, no doubt.  But I never got the type of rush and the high of feeling like the most clever person in the room whenever I wrote an elegant line of code, or a program behaved exactly I thought it would.

Back to the traffic jam in Napa…
 
After taking my first wave of exams to attain my license as a Professional Civil Engineer, and taking a break before the second wave of exams to come up in October, I was drowned in my own thoughts whilst all the passengers in the car was fast asleep.  
 
I realized that I was falling victim to the sunken cost fallacy, and justified working at a job that never felt right because I had invested 5.5 years of schooling towards it.  
 
Over my 18+ months working in San Francisco, everyone I met seemed to be in tech. I also met two civil engineering graduates, one who told me about his foray into a local programming bootcamp, and another who told me he self-studied programming for six months straight taking un-prescribed Adderall and is now working as a developer.  (I'm choosing the former route by the way)  
 
Everything just fell into place during that car ride, and here I am in my seventh week at Flatiron's Online Web Development Program, and my brain feels as stimulated as it's ever been since those Red Bull nights back in UC Davis.  
 
Excited to be here, and I can't wait to see what happens next from here.
